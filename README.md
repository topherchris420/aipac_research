# AIPAC Research Assistant

An advanced, AI-powered research assistant that leverages the Google Gemini API with Google Search grounding to provide current, factual, and sourced answers. This implementation is specifically focused on providing information related to AIPAC.

## ✨ Features

-   **AI-Powered Responses**: Get detailed, human-like answers to your research queries generated by Google's `gemini-2.5-flash` model.
-   **Real-time, Factual Information**: Responses are grounded in real-time Google Search results, ensuring the information is up-to-date and accurate.
-   **Verifiable Sources**: Every response is accompanied by a list of web sources used by the AI, allowing for easy fact-checking and further reading.
-   **Live Updates Feed**: Stay informed with a dedicated section that automatically fetches and displays the latest news and developments related to AIPAC.
-   **Voice-to-Text Input**: Use the integrated microphone button to speak your query, which is transcribed in real-time.
-   **Intelligent Follow-ups**: Easily refine a response for more detail or summarize it for a quick overview with one-click actions.
-   **Suggested Queries**: Get started quickly with a curated list of relevant research prompts.
-   **Modern UI**: A clean, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing interface built with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Light & Dark Modes**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes to suit your preference.
-   **Shareable Results**: Share or copy your findings, including the query, response, and sources, with a single click.

## 🚀 How It Works

This application is a single-page application built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It communicates directly with the **Google Gemini API** from the client-side.

1.  **User Input**: The user enters a query via text or voice.
2.  **API Call**: The `geminiService` sends the query to the Gemini API, specifically configured to use the `googleSearch` tool.
3.  **Grounded Generation**: The Gemini model processes the query, performs a real-time Google Search to gather current information, and generates a response based on the search results.
4.  **Response & Sources**: The API returns the generated text and the metadata of the web sources (`groundingChunks`) it used.
5.  **Rendering**: The React frontend displays the formatted response, source cards, and follow-up actions.
6.  **Live Updates**: On page load, a separate, non-grounded API call fetches the latest news updates on the topic, configured to return structured JSON.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (for voice input).
-   A Google AI Studio API Key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-research-assistant.git
    cd ai-research-assistant
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    This project requires your Google Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable. You will need to configure your hosting environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or a local server) to provide `process.env.API_KEY` to the application.

    For local development, you can create a `.env` file and use a tool like `vite` to serve the project, which will automatically load the key.
    
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory and add your key:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

3.  **Deployment:**
    To deploy this project, you will need to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

    **GitHub Pages Deployment**

    1.  **Deploy:**
        Run the `deploy` script to build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages:
        `npm run deploy`
    2.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
        In your GitHub repository settings, under "Pages," ensure that the source is set to the `gh-pages` branch.

4.  **Run the application:**
    Since the project uses ES modules and an `importmap`, you can run it with a simple local server.
    ```bash
    # If you have npm/npx installed
    npx serve
    ```
    Then, open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the server) in your browser.
